# 🪙 XYZ Smart Contract

A simple beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract built to demonstrate the fundamentals of Ethereum smart contract development — including deployment, ownership, and state management.

---

## 🚀 Project Description

The **XYZ Smart Contract** is a minimal example of how to write, deploy, and interact with a Solidity contract on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It allows a user (the contract owner) to store and update a message securely on-chain.  

This project serves as a great starting point for developers who are new to blockchain development and want to understand how smart contracts work at a basic level.

---

## 💡 What It Does

- Stores a text message on the Ethereum blockchain.  
- Allows only the contract owner (the deployer) to update the message.  
- Makes the stored message publicly readable for anyone.  
- Demonstrates how to interact with contracts using Remix or web3 tools.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Ownership Control:** Only the deployer (owner) can change the message.  
- **Immutable Deployment Info:** The contract stores the deployer’s address permanently.  
- **Public Read Function:** Anyone can view the current message.  
- **Gas Efficient:** Simple logic with minimal storage and computation costs.  
- **Upgradeable Design:** Easy to extend with new functionality (e.g., versioning, timestamps, or events).

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. Visit [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)  
2. Create a new file named `XYZContract.sol`  
3. Paste your Solidity contract code  
4. Compile with Solidity compiler version `0.8.x`  
5. Deploy the contract using the “Deploy & Run” tab  
6. Interact with your contract (view message, set new message, etc.)

### 💬 Example Message Flow

1. Deploy contract with message `"Hello Blockchain!"`  
2. Call `getMessage()` → returns `"Hello Blockchain!"`  
3. Call `setMessage("Welcome to XYZ!")` as owner → updates message  
4. Call `getMessage()` again → returns `"Welcome to XYZ!"`
